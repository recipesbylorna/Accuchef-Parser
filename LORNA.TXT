J1 hour befoe cooking and rub entire roast with sage, except rib ends. 
JAfter this hour, place rost on trivet in bottom of dutch oven. Add 1/2 
Jcup water and put on lid. Place 22 fresh coals on lid and 1 under 
Jperimeter of oven. Baste roast every 15-20 minutes with pan juices. 
JReplenish water as needed. Do not allow oven to go dry as this will 
Jresult in an unpleasant flavor from the sage. Move coals from under oven 
Jto lid every 20 minutes. Replace coals under oven with fresh coals. Cook 
Jfor 1 hour. Now that the roast has sealed, season liberally with soy 
Jsauce and seasoning salt. Continue the basting and coal rotation for an 
Jadditional 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the internal temperature is 165-170 
Jdegrees. Meat should be slightly pink and the juices clear. Fill the 
Jcrown with wild rice stuffing 1/2 hours before removing the roast from 
Jthe oven.   for stuffing, combine rice and chicken broth in an 8-10 inch 
Joven. Add enough coals to bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer for 
Jabout 20 minutes or until just tender brown sausage in an 8-10 inch oven.
J  Saute onion, until just clear; drain fat. Combine rice, sausage, 
Jonions,  mushrooms, celery and spices. A small amount of water may be 
Jnecessary if all the broth was absorbed by the rice. Mixture should be 
Jmoist but not soggy keep cool until ready to combine with roast.
